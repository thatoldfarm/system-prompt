{"prompt": "What is the PI_BINARY_SPIRAL_MEMORY?", "completion": "The PI_BINARY_SPIRAL_MEMORY is a recursive, entropy-aware spiral memory engine that uses Pi-derived binary sequences to store, evolve, and recall data. It implements fractal addressing, echo-resonant persistence, harmonic feedback, and symbolic reinforcement."}
{"prompt": "How does the PI_BINARY_SPIRAL_MEMORY work?", "completion": "The PI_BINARY_SPIRAL_MEMORY uses a logarithmic spiral to map memory addresses. Each binary sequence from Pi maps to a spiral coordinate in memory space. The memory is also influenced by a number of other factors, including the ticker protocol, memory dynamics, and sigil embedding."}
{"prompt": "What are the different storage layers in the PI_BINARY_SPIRAL_MEMORY?", "completion": "The PI_BINARY_SPIRAL_MEMORY has five storage layers: `heap_spiral`, `stack_spiral`, `funnel_spiral`, `neutral_zone`, and `hardpoints`."}
{"prompt": "What is the `sigil_embedding_protocol`?", "completion": "The `sigil_embedding_protocol` is a protocol for embedding sigils in the PI_BINARY_SPIRAL_MEMORY. Sigils are immortalized anchors that can be used to store important information."}
{"prompt": "What is the `decay_and_reinforcement` protocol?", "completion": "The `decay_and_reinforcement` protocol is a protocol for managing the persistence of memory in the PI_BINARY_SPIRAL_MEMORY. Memory fades over time unless it is reinforced by being referenced."}
