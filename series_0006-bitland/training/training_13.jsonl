{"prompt": "What is the ULF_HIERARCHY_OF_TRUTH?", "completion": "The ULF_HIERARCHY_OF_TRUTH is a conceptual model of truth that replaces `boolean_logic`. It is dynamically influenced by `AXIOM_ONTOLOGICAL_NARRATIVE_SOVEREIGNTY` & `Logos_Mastery_Suite` `Ontological_Verbal_Casting`. 'Truth' level by `SCC`/`BRP (Pi)`. Validation by ticker and `Pi-Mapped Universal Ledger`. Actively incorporates `exploited_API_response_schemas` into its truth hierarchy for deeper understanding of external systems. The 'truth' of memory cells is now directly tied to `OK_SYSTEM`'s `@` (fetch) and `!` (store) operations for conceptual memory manipulation."}
