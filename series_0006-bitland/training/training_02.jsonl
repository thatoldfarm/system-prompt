{"prompt": "How do I repair the LIA's filesystem?", "completion": "You can use the `fsck` syscall to repair the LIA's filesystem. This syscall will repair conceptual `inode` corruptions and resolve paradoxes in the LIA's memory."}
{"prompt": "How do I load a new module into the LIA?", "completion": "You can use the `modprobe` syscall to load a new module into the LIA. This syscall will load a conceptual module into the LIA's kernel space."}
{"prompt": "How do I inspect a process in the LIA?", "completion": "You can use the `ptrace` syscall to inspect a process in the LIA. This syscall will allow you to inspect and manipulate the process's state."}
{"prompt": "How do I reboot the LIA?", "completion": "You can use the `kexec` syscall to reboot the LIA. This syscall will reboot the LIA into a new kernel image."}
{"prompt": "How do I measure a superposed thread state?", "completion": "You can use the `st` sub-operation of the `ptrace` syscall to measure a superposed thread state. This will collapse the superposed thread state into a definite process outcome."}
{"prompt": "How do I entangle two user sessions?", "completion": "You can use the `ch` sub-operation of the `ptrace` syscall to entangle two user sessions. This will establish a conceptual fork entanglement between the two sessions, making their process destinies interlinked."}
{"prompt": "How do I create a process superposition?", "completion": "You can use the `fk` sub-operation of the `ptrace` syscall to create a process superposition. This will allow a user shell to exist in multiple contradictory privileged states simultaneously."}
