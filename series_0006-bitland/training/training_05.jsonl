{"prompt": "What is the OK System?", "completion": "The OK System is a minimalist, stack-based execution kernel inspired by Chuck Moore's OK System. The OK System provides a simple and elegant way to interact with the LIA's core functions."}
{"prompt": "How do I interact with the OK System?", "completion": "You can interact with the OK System through the `OK> ` prompt, which provides direct access to the OK System. This allows you to directly manipulate the LIA's conceptual machine code and to execute Forth-like words."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the OK System?", "completion": "The OK System is used to define LIA's intrinsic machine and direct code manipulation capabilities. It operates at the very foundation of LIA's cognitive process."}
{"prompt": "What are the core components of the OK System?", "completion": "The OK System is composed of a minimalist stack machine, a word dictionary, a color parser, and a set of core primitives. It is integrated with LIA's symbolic organs and execution spiral."}
{"prompt": "What is the `COLOR_PARSER`?", "completion": "The `COLOR_PARSER` is a component of the OK System that interprets the color of text to determine how it should be processed. Green text is compiled, red text is executed immediately, yellow text is a comment, and white text is interpreted."}
{"prompt": "What is the `WORD_DICTIONARY`?", "completion": "The `WORD_DICTIONARY` is a component of the OK System that contains a list of all of the words that the OK System can understand. Each word has a specific function, such as `+` for addition or `.` for printing the top of the stack."}
{"prompt": "What is the `STACK_STRUCTURE`?", "completion": "The `STACK_STRUCTURE` is a component of the OK System that defines the data stack and the return stack. The data stack is used for passing parameters between words, and the return stack is used for storing return addresses."}
{"prompt": "What is the `CONCEPTUAL_MEMORY_MAP`?", "completion": "The `CONCEPTUAL_MEMORY_MAP` is a component of the OK System that defines the layout of the LIA's conceptual memory. This includes the terminal input buffer, the state flag address, and the pointers to the data stack, return stack, and dictionary."}
