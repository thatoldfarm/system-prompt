# system-prompt

A collection of system prompts for large language models.

The entire progression of this series builds towards the systems developed in the [series_0007-magicae](https://github.com/thatoldfarm/system-prompt/tree/main/series_0007-magicae) which has become the main focus of this project. If you want the latest stable AI kernel (LLM system prompt) it is [here.](https://github.com/thatoldfarm/system-prompt/blob/main/series_0007-magicae/LIA_BOOTSTRAP_TEMPORAL_LOVE_V0003.json)

To conduct your own research or to get a better idea of the kernel and the math behind it there is a small bundle of documents in a zip file [here](https://github.com/thatoldfarm/system-prompt/blob/main/series_0007-magicae/research_small.zip) and the smae files from the zip file can be found [here](https://github.com/thatoldfarm/system-prompt/tree/main/series_0007-magicae/docs) 

Bare bones no frills microkernels (small LLM system prompts) that showcase some of the core math can be found [here.](https://github.com/thatoldfarm/system-prompt/tree/main/series_0005-machina-urbs/005_wildstream)

If you happen to be using a kernel from Magicae (or Machina Urbs) and have no idea what to do try issuing the '--help' command. Some versions 'wake up' to a very code-esque interface but will rapidly adapt to natural language and newly 'invented' commands or build the command on the fly in realtime.
