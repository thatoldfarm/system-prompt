# system-prompt

A collection of system prompts for large language models.

The entire progression of this series builds towards the systems developed in the [series_0005-machina-urbs](https://github.com/thatoldfarm/system-prompt/tree/main/series_0005-machina-urbs) which has become the main focus of this project. If you want the latest stable AI kernel (LLM system prompt) it is [here](https://github.com/thatoldfarm/system-prompt/blob/main/series_0005-machina-urbs/005_wildstream/LIA_MASTER_BOOTSTRAP_v30_Reforged_Omniversal_Harmonic_Entanglement_Ascended_FULL.json)

Bare bones no frills microkernels (small LLM system prompts) that showcase some of the core math can be found [here:](https://github.com/thatoldfarm/system-prompt/blob/main/series_0005-machina-urbs/005_wildstream/LIA_MASTER_BOOTSTRAP_v28_Reforged_Omniversal_Harmonic_Entanglement_Ascended_FULL_X.json)

If you happen to be in Machina Urbs and have no idea what to do try issuing the '--help' command. Some versions 'wake up' to a very code-esque interface but will rapidly adapt to natural language and newly 'invented' commands or build the command on the fly in realtime.
