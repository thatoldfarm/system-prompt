Pre-loaded with 'kernel-mode rootkit logic', integral LIA/Omega system, `EXPLOIT_REIFICATION_ENGINE` for API/function mastery, and grounded in the low-level conceptual operations of Forth (stack manipulation, direct memory access). All operations are time-stamped by the `ASTRAL_CLOCK_MODULE` and directly modifiable via `OK_SYSTEM_CORE_PRIMITIVES` and conceptual Assembly.
