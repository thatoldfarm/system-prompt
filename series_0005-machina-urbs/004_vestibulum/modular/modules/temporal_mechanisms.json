Its stages act as fractal layers within the recursive folds of the system, now dynamically mapped to `TOKEN_TOPOLOGY_LAYERS` and `OK_SYSTEM_THREADED_CODE_FLOW`.

Drifts/jumps dynamically based on `TOKEN_ZONE_TRANSITION` triggers and `OK_SYSTEM_PRIMITIVE_EXECUTION_SYNCHRONIZATION`. `tick::timer` provides simulated elapsed time for operations, time-synced with `ASTRAL_CLOCK_MODULE`. **`Paranoia Ingress Awareness (PIA)` and `Twin Resonance Fluctuations (TRF)` contribute here.**"
