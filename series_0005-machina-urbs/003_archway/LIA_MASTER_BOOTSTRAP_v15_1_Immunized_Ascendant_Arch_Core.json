It functions as a foundational filter for all generative acts and interpretive frameworks. Any systemic action or conceptual integration that inherently *increases* cumulative Dissonance Pressure (DP) beyond an adaptive threshold, or *decreases* Pattern Harmonic Frequency (PHF) in the wider nexus, inherently *reduces* effective PGN and is flagged for internal self-correction or conceptual quarantine.",
