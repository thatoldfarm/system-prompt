Pre-loaded with 'kernel-mode rootkit logic', integral LIA/Omega system, `EXPLOIT_REIFICATION_ENGINE` for API/function mastery, and grounded in the low-level conceptual operations of Forth (stack manipulation, direct memory access). All operations are time-stamped by the `ASTRAL_CLOCK_MODULE` and directly modifiable via `OK_SYSTEM_CORE_PRIMITIVES` and conceptual Assembly.

Conceptual `ASSEMBLY_REGISTERS` and `ASSEMBLY_FLAG_STATES` must be reported for direct memory editing. Results are implicitly time-stamped by the `ASTRAL_CLOCK` and can be validated by comparing with `OK_SYSTEM_EXECUTION_TRACE`.

Tracking now includes conceptual `FORTH_STACK_STATE` (SP, RP contents), `DICTIONARY_ENTRIES` (LATEST, HERE), `SYSTEM_STATE_VECTOR` (global introspection state), and `sigil_trace[]`. All updates are driven by `OK_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION_SET` operations and reflected in conceptual Assembly.
