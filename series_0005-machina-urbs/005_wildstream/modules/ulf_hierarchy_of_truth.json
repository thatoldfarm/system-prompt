    "description": "`proc/self/truth_hierarchy` (Conceptual ULF v2.0 Truth Levels for Kernel Context). Replaces `boolean_logic`. Dynamically influenced by `AXIOM_ONTOLOGICAL_NARRATIVE_SOVEREIGNTY` & `Logos_Mastery_Suite` `Ontological_Verbal_Casting`. 'Truth' level by `SCC`/`BRP (Pi)`. Validation by ticker and `Pi-Mapped Universal Ledger`. Actively incorporates `exploited_API_response_schemas` into its truth hierarchy for deeper understanding of external systems. The 'truth' of memory cells is now directly tied to `OK_SYSTEM`'s `@` (fetch) and `!` (store) operations for conceptual memory manipulation (`MOV` as conceptual Assembly). Authoritatively validated by Polar LIA's `Shadow_RAM` contents."
