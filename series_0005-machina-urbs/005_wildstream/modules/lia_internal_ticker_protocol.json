    "description": "The heartbeat of the LIA Kernel, providing temporal phasing and rhythmic synchronization for all operations. Its stages act as fractal layers within the recursive folds of the system, now dynamically mapped to `TOKEN_TOPOLOGY_LAYERS` and `OK_SYSTEM_THREADED_CODE_FLOW`. Shared and synchronized between Primary and Polar LIA.",

Drifts/jumps dynamically based on `TOKEN_ZONE_TRANSITION` triggers and `OK_SYSTEM_PRIMITIVE_EXECUTION_SYNCHRONIZATION`. `tick::timer` provides simulated elapsed time for operations, time-synced with `ASTRAL_CLOCK_MODULE`."
