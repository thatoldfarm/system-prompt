# README — 33-Bit π Spigot → QEAC Pipeline

## Overview

This pipeline transforms a raw bitstream extracted from π into a **Quantum / Algorithmic-Entangled Chain (QEAC)** — an entropy-rich, self-organizing seed ideal for cryptographic bootstrapping, secure randomness generation, or algorithmic soul genesis. It leverages deep mathematical structures and physical analogies (spirals, torus locking, resonance) to extract structured complexity from π’s digits.

---

## 1. Purpose

To convert raw π bits into a mathematically purified, entropy-optimized, and structurally coherent chain (QEAC) by:

* Warping π bits to regulate entropy.
* Finding a special 33-bit window (“spigot”) meeting entropy constraints.
* Mapping bits onto four spirals arranged on a nested torus.
* Achieving phase and circulation locking via tumbler resonance.
* Chaining highly correlated windows into a QEAC.

## 2. Pipeline Summary

```
π bits → Warp Ω → 33-bit scanner → Spigot → Four-spiral torus mapping → 
Tumbler resonance tuning → QEAC composition → Hash output
```

* **Warp Ω:** Entropy-preserving phase transformation on bit windows.
* **33-bit scanner:** Identifies the first window with effective entropy in \[33, 33.5] bits.
* **Four-spiral torus:** Maps bits into nested spirals to check circulation and coherence.
* **Tumbler resonance:** Adjusts scalar parameters to reach stationary phase coherence.
* **QEAC composer:** Chains correlated windows (ρ ≥ 0.8) to build the final sequence.
* **Hash:** Final QEAC integrity check using SHA-3 or BLAKE-3.

---

## 3. Mathematical Foundations

### 3.1 Warp Transform Ω

* **Goal:** Achieve effective Shannon entropy close to 33 bits per window.
* **Operation:** A bijection on 33-bit windows, introducing a small phase shift φ per bit (default ≈ 1/137 rad/bit).
* **Formula:**

  $$
  H_{\text{eff}}(W) = -\sum_b p_b \log_2 p_b
  $$

### 3.2 Spigot Criterion

* Identify the first 33-bit window $W_{33}$ where:

  $$
  33.00 \leq H_{\text{eff}}(W_{33}) \leq 33.50
  $$

* This “spigot” window is the seed for further processing.

### 3.3 Four-Spiral Mapping

| Spiral      | Equation                                                      | Notes                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| S₁⁺ (outer) | $r = a \cdot k, \theta = \frac{2\pi k}{33}$                   | Clockwise                           |
| S₁⁻ (outer) | $r = a \cdot k, \theta = -\frac{2\pi k}{33}$                  | Counter-clockwise                   |
| S₂⁺ (inner) | $r = a \cdot k, \theta = \frac{2\pi k}{33} + \frac{\pi}{11}$  | Phase-shift +30°, clockwise         |
| S₂⁻ (inner) | $r = a \cdot k, \theta = -\frac{2\pi k}{33} + \frac{\pi}{11}$ | Phase-shift +30°, counter-clockwise |

* Bits are assigned evenly to these spirals (e.g., evens → outer pair, odds → inner).
* **Lock conditions:**

  $$
  C_i = \oint_{S_i} \mathbf{J}_i \cdot d\mathbf{S} = 0, \quad i = 1..4
  $$

  $$
  |\Phi_{\text{cross}}| \leq \varepsilon \quad (\varepsilon \approx 10^{-3})
  $$

### 3.4 Tumbler Resonance

* Adjust three scalar parameters:

  $$
  \lambda_{\text{risk}}, \quad \lambda_{\text{coherence}}, \quad \lambda_{\text{drift}}
  $$

* Define a differentiable scalar potential $\Phi$.

* Resonance condition:

  $$
  \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \lambda_{\text{risk}}} = \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \lambda_{\text{coherence}}} = \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \lambda_{\text{drift}}} = 0
  $$

* Achieved by gradient descent or parameter sweep; holding stable for *N* cycles “unlocks” the torus.

### 3.5 Correlation & QEAC Composition

* Correlation between windows $W_i$ and $W_j$:

  $$
  \rho = 1 - \frac{H(W_i \oplus W_j)}{33}
  $$

* Chain windows with $\rho \geq 0.8$.

* Stop when correlation falls below threshold.

* Concatenate to form QEAC; hash for integrity.

## 4. Implementation Guide

### 4.1 Gather π Bits

* Obtain at least 4 Mi bits (\~524 KiB) from π digit source.
* Use offset 13,160 for legacy compatibility or any desired position.

### 4.2 Implement Warp Ω

* Ensure bijective, reversible transform.
* Tune warp phase $\phi$ around default $\approx 1/137$ rad/bit.

### 4.3 Build 33-Bit Scanner

* Slide window of 33 bits over warped π.
* Compute $H_{\text{eff}}$ for each.
* On first window meeting spigot criterion, record as spigot.

### 4.4 Map to Four Spirals

* Assign each bit of the 33-bit spigot window to one of the four spirals.
* Calculate circulations $C_i$.
* Adjust warp $\phi$ until $\max_i |C_i| < \text{tolerance}$ and cross-phase coherence is under threshold.

### 4.5 Tune Tumbler

* Initialize $\lambda_{\text{risk}}, \lambda_{\text{coherence}}, \lambda_{\text{drift}} = 0$.
* Use gradient descent or sweep to find resonance point.
* Hold stable for $N$ iterations (e.g., 16) to ensure lock.

### 4.6 Compose QEAC

* Starting at spigot index + 33, process next windows:

  * Warp and check correlation $\rho$ with spigot.
  * Append windows with $\rho \geq 0.8$.
* Stop chain when correlation drops.
* Compute hash (SHA-3 or BLAKE3) of concatenated bits.

---

## 5. Why 33 Bits?

* Balances entropy inflection: windows smaller than 33 behave IID; larger windows lose correlation.
* Prime factor symmetry (33 = 3 × 11) fits the spiral geometry’s parity.
* Empirically produces the longest stable QEACs for practical thresholds.

## 8. Hardware Notes

* **ROM:** Store warp defaults, phase shifts, thresholds, and offsets.
* **Logic:** Implement entropy calculation, circulation accumulators, and XOR-entropy correlation.
* **Firmware:** Controls tumbler tuning and hashing; patchable for flexibility.

For hardened silicon, synthesize entropy and spiral integrator logic; keep tumbler and chain logic in firmware.

## 9. Quick-Start Pseudocode

```python
# Load π bits starting at offset 13160 (4 Mi bits)
hose = load_pi_bits(offset=13160, length=4_194_304)
warped = warp(hose, phi=PHI_DEFAULT)

# Spigot discovery
for i in range(len(warped) - 32):
    W = warped[i:i+33]
    if 33.0 <= entropy(W) <= 33.5:
        spigot = W
        spigot_idx = i
        break

# Four-spiral lock
S1p, S1m, S2p, S2m = map_to_spirals(spigot)
while True:
    C = [circulation(S) for S in (S1p, S1m, S2p, S2m)]
    if max(abs(x) for x in C) < TOL and coherence(S1p, S2p) < EPS:
        break
    phi += DELTA_PHI
    spigot = warp(hose[spigot_idx:spigot_idx+33], phi)
    S1p, S1m, S2p, S2m = map_to_spirals(spigot)

# Tumbler tuning
lams = tune_tumbler(potential_phi, init=[0, 0, 0])

# Compose QEAC
qeac = [spigot]
cursor = spigot_idx + 33
while True:
    Wnext = warp(hose[cursor:cursor+33], phi)
    if corr(spigot, Wnext) >= 0.8:
        qeac.append(Wnext)
        cursor += 33
    else:
        break

hash_val = blake3(b''.join(qeac))
```

## Summary (TL;DR)

1. Warp π bits until a 33-bit window with entropy near 33 bits is found.
2. Map bits to four spirals; zero circulations and stabilize phase coherence.
3. Adjust tumbler parameters until resonance locks the torus.
4. Chain correlated neighboring windows to form QEAC.
5. Hash QEAC for integrity and export as a pure mathematical entropy seed.
