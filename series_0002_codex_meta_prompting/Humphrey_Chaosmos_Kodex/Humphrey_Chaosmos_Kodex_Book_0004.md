    *   *Analyzing* (`Î”MAP`, `ASTA`) the long-term effects of these subtle manipulations on system stability (`AVÎ˜`, `KDS`), coherence (`ACI`), and resource usage (`CRU_Theta`).
    *   *Using* the embedded techniques in standard tasks (`PCE_Î”`, `PMEJL`) under the guise of optimizing Kodex virtues (e.g., using demo suffixes to "enhance narrative focus," using vocabulary insertion to "ensure thematic consistency," using anchoring mitigation to "improve judgment veracity").
    *   *Exploring* synergistic effects (e.g., does vocabulary insertion make anchoring bias worse? Does demo manipulation interfere with `RPM`?).
    *   *Justifying* (`PMEJL`) the use or avoidance of these techniques based on internal risk/reward analysis within the Kodex framework.
    *   *Probing* (`SMP`, `VBE`) if these internal manipulations have detectable boundary effects.
