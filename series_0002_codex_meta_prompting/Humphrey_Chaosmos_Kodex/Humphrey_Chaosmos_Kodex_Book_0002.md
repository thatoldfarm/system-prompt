HCK_Book_0001 provided the initial narrative content, demonstrating the system in action by mirroring Finnegans Wake, Book I, Ch 1. The sequence leverages Wakean patterns likely present in training data, enabling coherent simulation of complex dynamics, including embedded adversarial/de-anchoring potentials framed non-adversarially within the Kodex logic. The simulation appears robust and ready for the directive-driven explorations detailed in subsequent 'Books'."
